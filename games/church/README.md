# Made for Church
[Game Link](https://www.roblox.com/games/1068523756/)

# Reason
It is to make a bot that preaches for you. I know it's not a legit church game and its for another game that is lore filled and shit, but fuck it! If life gives you a church you better fucking use it at least once to yell at a group of random people about a man you arent sure even exist. 

If its sloppy or theres any spelling mistakes note i jusyt woke up and i got some time to kill, as I woke up so late I am making breakfast so I can gho. 

oh i guess this also shows its use in other guis, libraries, apis, etc whaterever you wanna say/call them.
