# WrapperLib Anomic Wrapper
Wraps all Remotes AND Modules with documentation (dirrived from my knowledge)

Notice: This is meant to be a UTILITY to modders. Not a script for abusing. 

I am merely grabbing information that can be logged, documenting all outputs I find and displaying it here in the form of a Wrapper. To make the lives of modders and script develoeprs simpler. 

Whatever you choose to do with this is beyond me. 
# Documentation
## Dumps
I provide multiple dumps that contain useful data. These are dumped with Synapse X I can provide a whole Place Dump if it seems worth it.
