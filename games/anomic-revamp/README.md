# WrapperLib Anomic Wrapper
Wraps all Remotes AND Modules with documentation (dirrived from my knowledge)

Notice: This is meant to be a UTILITY to modders. Not a script for abusing. 

I am merely grabbing information that can be logged, documenting all outputs I find and displaying it here in the form of a Wrapper. To make the lives of modders and script develoeprs simpler. 

Whatever you choose to do with this is beyond me. 

# NOTICE

Pending a rewrite. 

Dumps folder will be kept.
